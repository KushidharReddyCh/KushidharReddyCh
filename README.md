## Hello I am Kushidhar

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I graduated from NIT Rourkela with a degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering in 2023. Currently, I am a Backend Developer at GreyOrange, specializing in Erlang, Python, and technologies such as Kafka, Elastic Stack, InfluxDB, and PostgreSQL. I also have strong skills in Java, with a focus on data structures, algorithms, and system design at both low and high levels.

My experience includes internships at Advenio.ai as a Deep Learning Research Engineer, where I worked on advanced image compression, and at GoGlocal as an NLP Engineer, where I focused on natural language processing technologies.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing the violin, which helps me maintain a healthy work-life balance.
